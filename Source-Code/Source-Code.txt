FX.DLL Version 0.16 Source-Code
Copyright © Martins Skujenieks 2003


----
Because many people on Planet-Source-Code 
(PSC) asked me to share source-code of the
FX library, I included it in this submission.
This is source-code of early FX library
(build Jan-19-2003; version 0.16 alpha).
Most of functions has changed a lot to 
version 1.02 release, but the coding base is
still the same.
And what is the most important, this code can
help you to learn how to create DLL's in C++
for use with Visual Basic!!


----
To view source-code, start Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0,
click File menu, point to Open Workspace and click
once again. Browse for the FX.DSW (workspace) file
and open it.

You will notice that this early version already has
1400 lines of code and only 18 functions. Imagine
the current FX.DLL 1.02 version with 5400 lines of
code :)
